### HTTPS:
- Browsers send HTTPS/HTTP requests to servers, the server then responds with the resource needed.
- HTTP protocols have easy error messages (404, 503).
- HTTPS encrypts all data sent to the server, to avoid a data leak.
- HTTP is used by IoT Devices (Internet of Things, home devices) to communicate with each other.

### TCP:
- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) ensures accurate data transmission.
- TCP will resend lost or corrupted data in the form of packets.
- TCP reorders packets to the sent order upon arrival at their destination, ensuring that the data is presented correctly.

### SSH:
- SSH stands for **Secure Shell**.
- It is a network protocol used for secure connections between devices over an unsecured network.
- Primarily used for remote logins and command execution.
- SSH typically uses TCP port 22 by default.

### SFTP:
- **Secure File Transfer Protocol**.
- Used to securely transfer files between computers over an encrypted connection, as part of SSH (secure shell).
- SFTP encrypts data being sent along with authentication credentials (usernames and passwords), keeping data safe.

### FTPS:
- **File Transfer Protocol Secure**.
- FTPS is used to securely upload, download, and manage files between a client and a server.
- Ensures files are not altered or corrupted during transmission.
- FTPS protects sensitive data from being intercepted during transmission (passwords, file contents).

### IP/IPv6:
- Every server and client is identified by an IP address (IPv4 or IPv6).
- Data is divided into packets, IP ensures these packets are correctly routed to their destination.
- IP determines how quickly packets are routed, which could slow down transmission speed.
- IPv6 offers better reliability in modern networks.
- Provides IoT devices (household devices) unique addressing for communication.

### IMAP:
- **Internet Message Access Protocol**.
- Allows email clients to retrieve messages from the email server.
- Allows emails to be synchronized without having to be downloaded to the local device.
- Supports the use of folders for organization.
